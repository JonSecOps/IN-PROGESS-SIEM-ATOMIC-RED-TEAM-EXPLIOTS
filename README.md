# SIEM / MITRE Framework / Atomic Red Team Exploit Project
**Project Summary:**
This project demonstrates the deployment of MITRE ATT&CK techniques using Atomic Red Team to simulate and detect cyber exploits. It focuses on **MITRE ATT&CK ID:** T1136.001 (Create Account - Local Account) to illustrate adversarial activity through simulated attacks. Key components include the configuration of Splunk for telemetry, PowerShell execution, and leveraging SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to monitor and analyze attack behaviors.

**Learning Points:**
1.	**MITRE ATT&CK Framework:** Gained understanding of MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, specifically T1136.001 (Create Local Account under Persistence tactic).
2.	**Atomic Red Team Usage:** Installed and deployed Atomic Red Team to simulate attack scenarios on a controlled target environment.
3.	**SIEM Integration:** Configured SIEM (Splunk) for attack visibility and monitoring to detect malicious activities.
4.	**Powershell for Execution:** Leveraged PowerShell for executing simulated techniques and gathering local user account information.
5.	**System Hardening Awareness:** Configured and reviewed Windows exclusions in Virus & Threat Protection settings to enable controlled testing.
6.	**Attack Telemetry Analysis:** Captured and analyzed telemetry data from Splunk to understand attack order and validate detection capabilities.

**Key Skills Developed:**
1. Adversary Simulation with Atomic Red Team
2. MITRE ATT&CK Tactic and Technique Mapping
3. SIEM Configuration and Telemetry Analysis
4. Windows Environment Setup for Attack Simulation
5. PowerShell Scripting for Exploit Execution
